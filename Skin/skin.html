                    MicroCurrent technology uses gentle electrical
                    stimulation to trigger the body's natural skin
                    enchancing chemicals at a cellular level. Clinical
                    studies have shown collagen production increases
                    by 14%, elasting increases by 48%, and blood
                    circulation increases by 38% after 20 days of
                    treatment. Scientists have also found that
                    microcurrent triggers amino acids and ATP production
                    which accelerate cellular repair and promote healthier
                    cell production. For more than a century, physicians
                    and alternative medicine practitioners have used
                    microcurrent to treat a broad array of injuries,
                    wounds, soft tissue and bone fracture.

                    <strong>Microcurrent and injectables:</strong>
                    Utilizing both technologies maximize the end result.
                    Fillers give a quick and effective "filling" effect,
                    diminishing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.
                    However they do nothing for muscle contour, natural
                    collagen or elastin production, all of which are
                    addressed with microcurrent. Many doctors find it
                    necessary to sculpt and contour the muscles of the face
                    to maximize and complete the effect of fillers.
                    Microcurrent is recommended 2 weeks after Botox and/or
                    fillers. Many clients and doctors see prolonged effects
                    of Botox when used in conjunction with microcurrent.
                    Because of it's healing properties, microcurrent is
                    recognized as the tool of choice by surgeons for pre and
                    post-op applications.

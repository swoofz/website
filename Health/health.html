                        Acupuncture is the use of very fine needles strategically placed to stimulate the body's
                        self-healing mechanisms. Acupuncture stimulates the nervous system by activating nociceptor,
                        sensory nerves and proprioceptor fibers that travel from the skin too the spine and into the
                        brain. Acupuncture dilates blood vessels, increasing blood flow, and improves the nerve
                        signal
                        to the brain to stimulate the secretion of self-healing chemicals such as, endorphins
                        (natural
                        painkillers), and enkephalins. Acupuncture alone, or with Chinese herbal formulas, or as a

            <h2>Chinese Herbs</h2>

            <div>
                <p>
                    Chinese herbs have been used for centuries in Asian medicine practices. Formulations, comprised of
                    over 5,700 substances (plants, animals, and minerals) in the form to teas, granules, patents, and
                    tinctures have been passed down for generations. Today, there are 1,800 herbs in the Chinese
                    pharmacopeia, classified according to their energetic qualities, functions and the different
                    organs, meridians and disharmonies for which they address. Individual herbs are combined, using
                    government official hierarchy such as emperor, minister, assistant, or servant, in order to enhance
                    their actions and affects upon the body and create a unique synergistic formula. 
                    - The Emperor, Chief, or King herb is the ingredient that will have the greatest effect against the 
                        targeted pathology.
                    - The Minister or Deputy, is the ingredient with two functions: 
                        1) aiding the Emperor; and 
                        2) serves as the main ingredient targeted toward coexisting pathologies. 
                    - The Assistant is the ingredient with three different functions: 
                        1) Helpful Assistant: reinforces the Emperor or Minister, or potentially targets a less crucial 
                        pattern within the patholody. 
                        2) Corrective Assistant: moderates or eliminates toxicity or harsh properties of the minister or 
                        emperor. 
                        3) Opposing Assistant: used in complex disorders and has the opposite effect of the minister. 
                    - The Servant or Envoy, has two functions: 
                        1) guides the actions of the formula to specific channel or areas of body; and 
                        2) harmonizing and integrating the actions of the other ingredients. 
                    Additionally, to enhance the safe and effective use of the herbs, Chinese herbal medicine formulations 
                    are created according to six basic modes of herb-herb interactions; namely, reinforcement, potentiation, 
                    restraint, detoxification, counteraction, and toxicity. This combination increases the benefits of a 
                    particular formula, and minmizes any harmful side effects. Herbs are used in different quantities for 
                    different purposes to create the most effective and customized formula aimed at addressing the individual needs.

                <p>
                    Cupping is a therapy used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) to remove stagnation and stimulate
                    the flow of qi. Qi is the free flow of vital energy circulation through the body and the world
                    around us, if qi is disrupted or disturbed, it can create stagnation (blockages) or imbalances in
                    the body that cause pain and disease. 
                    Cupping involves creating suction and placing cups on the skin. The tissue and impurities are drawn up 
                    into the cup to remove toxins, loosen connective tissue or fascia, and stimulate blood flow to the surface 
                    causing tissue relaxation and better cell-to-cell communication. Using an ultrasound camera, research shows
                    cell-level changes demonstrating inflammatory cytokines (chemical messengers) are reduced, and cytokines 
                    that promote healing and relaxation are increased. 
                    Cupping may cause temporary bruising and soreness, depending upon the degree of suction created by the vacuum 
                    and the level of internal stagnation and suggests the treatment has successfully removed toxins and stagnation 
                    resolving swelling, pain, and tension.

                    Aromatherapy is a holistic healing treatment using plant extracts converted into aromatic essential
                    oils. Aromatherapy is thought of as both an art and a science. Ancient cultures in China, India,
                    Egypt, and elsewhere have used aromatherapy for centuries incorporating aromatic plant components in
                    resins, balms, and oils. Known to have both physical and psychological benefits, these natural
                    substances were used for medical and religious purposes. Recently, aromatherapy has gained more
                    recognition in the fields of science and medicine. T.A.M.E. TIME creates medicinal blends essential
                    oils using both complementary alternative medicine and Asian medicine parctices to improve the
